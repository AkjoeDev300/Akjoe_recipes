    <h3>How to cook Fried rice</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Set your cooking pot on heat, allow drying, then pour in about 200ml of vegetable oil.</li>
      <li>Allow heating, then add the sliced onions, stir for 1-2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Then add the chopped carrot and green beans, any of these two can actually go first.</li>
      <li>Add the sweet corn, stir.</li>
      <li>Meat stock (water from the meat) should follow, add ground pepper (optional), add a teaspoon of salt and, add 1
      seasoning cube then stir and taste, you may add more salt.</li>
      <li>Add the green peas.</li>
      <li>
        Stir for 1-2 minutes then add cabbage and the curry powder (Curry is a yellowish spice that actually adds the yellowish
        color to fried rice, add and stir till you are satisfied with the color.)
        <br>
        You would have a yellowish mixture that would often taste overly spiced, don't worry the rice would balance the taste
      </li>
      <li>If you are satisfied with the taste, then add the green pepper, stir.</li>
      <li>Add the almost-done white rice and stir</li>
      <li>Stir all together, cover your pot and allow to simmer for 5-7 minutes.</li>
      <li>Serve with the fried or fried meat (chicken).</li>

    </ol>
