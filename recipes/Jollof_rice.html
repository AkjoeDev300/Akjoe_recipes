    <h3>Steps to Making Jollof Rice</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Take a blender and add plum tomatoes, roasted red bell peppers, onion, and a scotch bonnet pepper. Blend until you
        have
        a smooth, spicy paste.</li>
      <li>In a large saucepan, add sunflower oil and heat over high heat. Once the oil is hot, pour in the blended sauce and
        cook
        over medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring.</li>
      <li>To the cooked sauce, add salt, thyme, knorr cubes, curry powder (optional), tomato paste (pur√©e), and chicken
        stock.
        Stir and cook for another 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>To the saucepan, add rinsed long grain white rice to the saucepan and stir. Add water to cover the rice and cook
        over
        medium-low heat for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>You may need to check the rice, add an additional cup of water, and stir every few minutes to prevent burning.
      </li>
      <li>Flavor the rice with bay leaves and half of a thinly sliced onion (optional), stir and cook over low heat until
        the rice
        is tender and flavor-packed.</li>
      <li>The delicious Jollof Rice was ready! Serve it with curd or curry!</li>
